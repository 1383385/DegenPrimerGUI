[DegenPrimer](https://github.com/allista/DegenPrimer) is a tool to check the quality of degenerate primers. 
It calculates melting temperatures, finds stable dimers, hairpins 
and crossdimers, uses BLAST search and full-fledged PCR simulation 
cycle by cycle to provide accurate predictions of possible PCR 
products and their quantities.

This is a graphical user interface for DegenPrimer.

It depends on PyQt4 >= 4.9
