DegenPrimer is a tool to check the quality of degenerate primers. It calculates 
melting temperatures, finds stable dimers, hairpins and crossdimers, makes a 
BLAST search for specificity and prepare input for ipcress (in silica PCR 
simulation program). It has a simple command line interface. It is written in 
python using BioPython library.

This is a graphical user interface for DegenPrimer.
It depends on python2 >= 2.7, Biopython >= 1.58 and python-qt4 >= 4.9
