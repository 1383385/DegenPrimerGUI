DegenPrimer is a tool to check the quality of degenerate primers.
It calculates melting temperatures, finds stable dimers, hairpins 
and crossdimers, makes a BLAST search for specificity and 
full-fledged PCR simulation cycle by cycle to provide accurate 
predictions of possible PCR products and their quantities.

This is a graphical user interface for it.

Dependencies: python2 >= 2.7 and python-qt4 >= 4.9
